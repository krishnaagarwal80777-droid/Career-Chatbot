City Crime Severity & Reporting Prediction
📋 Overview

This project analyzes and predicts crime severity and reporting rates across different crime categories for Indian cities.
It uses machine learning (K-Means and Random Forest) to uncover crime patterns, identify high-risk clusters, and estimate underreporting tendencies.

🎯 Objectives

Predict crime severity and reporting rates using multi-feature city-level data.

Cluster cities based on overall crime behavior and risk level.

Identify key factors influencing crime reporting across categories.

Provide a data-driven framework to assist policymakers and law enforcement.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Developed and tested in Google Colab

🧩 Model Summary

K-Means Clustering: groups cities by overall crime patterns.

Random Forest Regressor: predicts severity and reporting rates for each crime category.

Feature Importance: highlights the top factors affecting crime reporting.

📊 Key Insights

Strong correlation found between reporting rate and local cluster index.

Certain crime types (like property or negligence-related) showed predictable trends.

Random Forest achieved R² ≈ 0.87–0.93 for reporting rate prediction.
